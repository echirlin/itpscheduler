Exercise in creating Flask/React apps.

Every quarter, I manually construct a schedule of which ITP members are assigned to manage the Saturday classes for that quarter. Each member usually has certain days they can't make it, and there are usually some Saturdays that the school is closed, but members should generally have a somewhat-equivalent number of assignments per quarter. This will generate that list automatically based on the specific criteria of the quarter.
